description: 'This platform originates from the Hackathon SpaceApps Challenge 2014
  and integrates information about space missions from NASA, ESA, and JAXA with our
  learn-by-playing paradigm to let you dive into space knowledge in an exciting way!The
  next era of space exploration will be driven by distributed and open exploration
  ventures. Thousands of rovers and micro-probes will be surfing the System, controlled
  by many private and public institutions and, eventually, by private citizens, with
  the goal of collecting and sharing data. Space is too vast to have restricted access:
  cheap technologies (micro-satellites, social participation, open challenges, private
  launchers), multidisciplinarity, and always more specialized knowledge are taking
  part to the race.'
